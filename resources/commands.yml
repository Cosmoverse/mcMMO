#   {LEVEL_MAX_XP}  - The player's skill's level's max XP
#   {COMMAND}       - The name of the command
#
# There are a few more wildcards for specific to each skill.
#
# Wildcards in "guide" include:
#   {SKILL}         - The name of the skill
#   {PAGE}          - The current page's number
#   {PAGES}         - The total number of pages
